# CTEC 227 - Lab Nos. 7 and 8

## Display Idea Database Data Using Joins

This week you learned about database joins and how to code them in PHP. We used a seven table database design to present a meaningul display of data to users.

The code we developed has been shared in the Slack #code-from-class channel. Your task is to rewrite the code so that it removes all of the tabular data displays and replaces them with visually aesthetic ones. Use your knowledge of Bootstrap in your work.

You can look at the http://ideajam.net site to get some ideas. Note that the IdeaJam site only display limited info in the main view. You can also look at other sites that display posts, comments, likes and tags to get some ideas.

This lab will count for two lab assignments.

## Details

- Use the Bootstrap framework. Start with the [CTEC 127/227 template](https://github.com/belgort-clark/ctec-127-template).
- You will be responsible for setting up your CSS, include and any other folders you need for this lab. External CSS must be used.
- Place any and all functions in an external include folder.
- Use your skills and creativity to design a single page that shows all of the ideas, and for each idea the comments, likes and tags.
- The idea info needs to appear first. Feel free to intermingle the tags and such to appear right with the idea info. This is a lot easier than you think it is.
- All HTML and CSS must validate.
